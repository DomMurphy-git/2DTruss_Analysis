THE .MAT FILES

-We included the Practice Problem .mat information

-The remainder of the truss designs are custom designs

-The two designs we analyse in our report are TrussDesign1a_Leo_Dom_Mike_A6.mat and TrussDesign2a_DomLeoMichael_A6.mat

-We included all of the load functions for these .mat files in our mainGSTversion, to test our code with a specific .mat file, just comment out the ones you aren't using and uncommment the active file



THE .M FILES

-We have a mainGSTversion.m script that runs all of our code. This file should be ran

-The remainder of the .m files are functions that are ran within the main file and must be used in order to the script to function
